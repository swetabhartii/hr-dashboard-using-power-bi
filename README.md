My Project Link: https://github.com/swetabhartii/hr-dashboard-using-power-bi/blob/main/HR%20DASHBOARD%20Project.pdf

I developed a Power BI project to create a visually compelling dashboard addressing HR-related queries. This dashboard provides insights into key HR metrics such as employee turnover rates, hiring trends, and performance evaluations. By integrating data from various sources, the dashboard offers real-time analytics and visualizations that enable HR managers to make informed decisions. Key features include interactive charts, drill-down capabilities, and customized reports tailored to specific organizational needs. This project demonstrates the power of data visualization in optimizing HR processes and enhancing strategic planning.
