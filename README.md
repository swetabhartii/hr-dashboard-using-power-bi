HR DASHBOARD USING POWER BI

My Project Link: https://github.com/swetabhartii/hr-dashboard-using-power-bi/blob/main/HR%20DASHBOARD%20Project.pdf

I developed an HR dashboard using Power BI for my project, focusing on providing comprehensive insights into workforce data. The dashboard features key HR metrics such as employee demographics, headcount, attrition rates, and performance indicators. Interactive visualizations and filters allow users to explore data dynamically, identifying trends and making data-driven decisions. The project aims to streamline HR reporting, improve strategic planning, and enhance operational efficiency by presenting clear and actionable information. The use of Power BI's powerful analytical tools ensures that the dashboard is both visually appealing and highly functional.
